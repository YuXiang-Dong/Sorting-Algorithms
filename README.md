# Sorting-Algorithms
This is my sorting algorithm project.
I made this project in order to test out which sorting algorithm is the most efficient one to use under certain constraint.
## To run the program, type ```java SortingAlgRunner``` in the terminal

## Features
1. it can sort the algorithms by time.  //
2. you can limited the range of the element. (To test out specfic sorting algorithm such as counting sort) //
